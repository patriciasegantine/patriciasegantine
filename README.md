### Hello, I’m Patricia Segantine 👋

Front-End Developer with over five years of experience building user-facing features in product-led SaaS environments.

I mainly work with React, TypeScript and Next.js, focusing on performance, accessibility and clean, maintainable front-end architecture. I enjoy working on real products, in collaborative teams, where engineers have ownership and contribute to technical decisions.

In my current role, I work on a white-label, multi-tenant SaaS platform with a micro-frontend setup, owning the front-end delivery of public-facing features for a platform serving over 10 million users across B2B and B2C campaigns.
